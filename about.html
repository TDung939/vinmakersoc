        <h1>Mission & Vision</h1>
        <p>
            The core aim of VinMaker Society is to provide opportunities for students to learn practical
skills in engineering, innovation, and design as well as collaborate on shared ideas and projects.
By maintaining an active community of like-minded ‘makers’ and providing resources,
knowledge, and technology, the club seeks to foster an environment where anyone, regardless of
their background, can be inspired to turn their ideas into designs, prototypes, and products.
        </p>
        <h1>How can we help you?</h1>
        <p>
            We provide technical events to teach you new skills, as well as a fortnightly magazine to
keep you updated on what's new and exciting within the university, school, and industry.
        </p>
        <p>We create a platform for Engineering students to meet and collab.</p>
        <p>Students will become adept at using technical equipment in Makerspaces and SuperLab
            to ensure their safety as some of the equipment can be dangerous if not handled properly.</p>
        <p>More opportunities for students to have more hands-on experience as they can apply their
            theoretical knowledge through myriads of practical activities, projects, and competitions.</p>
        <p>
            Members will have the chance to showcase their projects at VinMaker Faire in May
2020.
        </p>
        <p>We host Tech Talks for students to meet and hear from guests working in the
            Engineering industry and for students to build their network within the field.</p>
        <p>We organize and run weekly events, including Trivia, Movie, Boardgame Nights, LAN
            Parties, Workshops, Code Jams, and Weekly BBQ. Events are open to all members, and
            nearly all are free to attend.</p>
